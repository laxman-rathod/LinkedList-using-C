# linkedList
 
A linked list is a fundamental data structure, It is a linear collection of data elements, where each element, called a node, consists of two parts: the actual data (or value) and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Linked lists provide a way to organize and store data in a dynamic, flexible manner.


**Types of Linked Lists:**

1. **Singly Linked List:** In a singly linked list, each node points to the next node in the sequence. The last node typically points to a null reference, indicating the end of the list.

2. **Doubly Linked List:** In a doubly linked list, each node has references to both the next and the previous nodes, enabling traversal in both directions. This makes operations like reverse traversal and insertions at both ends more efficient.

3. **Circular Linked List:** A circular linked list is a variation of singly or doubly linked lists in which the last node points back to the first node, forming a loop. It can be useful for applications involving circular data structures, like scheduling or round-robin algorithms.

**Applications of Linked Lists:**

Linked lists are used in a variety of applications:

1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Linked lists are suitable for dynamic memory allocation because they can easily grow or shrink as needed.

2. **Implementing Stacks and Queues:** Linked lists are the basis for implementing data structures like stacks and queues.

3. **Symbol Tables:** They are used in symbol tables of compilers, which map identifiers to their attributes.

4. **Music and Video Players:** Linked lists can be used to create playlists and keep track of the sequence of songs or videos to play.

5. **Undo Functionality:** Linked lists can be used to implement undo functionality in applications by storing previous states.

**Advantages of Linked Lists:**

1. **Dynamic Size:** Linked lists can grow or shrink as needed, making them suitable for situations where the size of the data structure is not known in advance.

2. **Efficient Insertions/Deletions:** Inserting or deleting an element at the beginning or in the middle of a linked list can be done in constant time (O(1)), which is more efficient than arrays.

3. **Memory Efficiency:** Linked lists only allocate memory for the actual data and references, which can be more memory-efficient compared to arrays.

**Disadvantages of Linked Lists:**

1. **Random Access:** Accessing elements in a linked list by their index (like arrays) is inefficient because you have to traverse the list from the beginning.

2. **Overhead:** Each node in a linked list requires extra memory for the reference to the next node (and previous node in the case of doubly linked lists), which can increase memory overhead.

3. **Cache Performance:** Linked lists may not utilize cache memory as efficiently as arrays because the data is scattered throughout memory.

4. **Complexity:** Implementing and managing linked lists can be more complex than using arrays for some applications.
